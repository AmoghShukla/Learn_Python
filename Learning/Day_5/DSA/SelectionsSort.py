# Selection Sort Algorithm Implementation in Python
# Selection Sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: a sorted and an unsorted region. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted region and moves it to the end of the sorted region.
# The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array:
# 1) The subarray which is already sorted.
# 2) The subarray which is unsorted.
