It is the foundation of Computer Science and Programming, the way data is organised, stored, processed to solve Problems Efficiently

Data Structures : How Data is Stored in Memory
Algorithm : Step by Step Procedure to Solve a Problem using the Data
Time Complexity : Time taken by a Program to be executed or the Number of Steps involved in Solving a processed
Space Complexity : Total Amount of Space taken to Execute a Program

Types of Data Structures :-
1) Primitive Data Structures : Built in Simple Type - int, float, boolean 
2) Non - Primitive Data Structures : Linear DS, Non - Linear DS, Hash based DS

-:Algorithm:-
1) Searching : Linear Search, Binary Search
2) Sorting : Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort


A Searching algorithm is used to find the location of a Specific ELement (target) in collection of Data.
