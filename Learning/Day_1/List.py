# # List in Python
# # Lists are ordered collections of items that can be of different types.
# # They are mutable, meaning their contents can be changed after creation.

# my_list = [1, 2, 3, 'four', 'five']
# print(my_list)

# # Append in python is used with lists to add a single element to the end of the list.
# my_list.append(6)
# print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 'four', 'five', 6]

# # Insert in python is used with lists to add an element at a specific position.
# my_list.insert(2, 'three')
# print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 'three', 3, 'four', 'five', 6]

# # Extend in python is used with lists to add multiple elements to the end of the list.
# lst1 = [1, 2, 3]
# lst2 = [4, 5, 6]
# lst1.extend(lst2)
# print(lst1)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Empty_List = [40, 70, 80, 90, 77]
# num = sum(Empty_List)
# # for i in Empty_List:
# #     num += i

# avg = num/len(Empty_List)
# print("Average of List is:", avg)


# Define a single value tuple
a = (5,)
print(type(a))
