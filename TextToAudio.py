Deep Learning for Image Recognition.
Image recognition in deep learning is the process where neural networks analyze images to classify, detect objects, or segment regions.
Core Techniques:
CNNs or Convolutional Neural Networks are the backbone of image recognition. They use convolutional layers to extract features from images.
Pooling Layers reduce spatial dimensions while retaining important features.
Fully Connected Layers classify the image based on extracted features.
Activation Functions like ReLU introduce non-linearity.
Pretrained Models such as ResNet, VGG, and InceptionNet are commonly used architectures for image recognition.

Training Process:
First, dataset preparation where images are labeled into categories.
Second, feature extraction where CNNs learn patterns like edges, textures, and shapes.
Third, backpropagation and optimization using a loss function such as cross-entropy.
Finally, evaluation using accuracy metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

Applications include facial recognition, medical diagnosis, autonomous vehicles, and security surveillance.

Probability, Continuous and Discrete Distributions.
Probability measures the likelihood of an event occurring, ranging between 0 and 1.
Discrete Distributions include:
Bernoulli Distribution, which deals with binary outcomes like success or failure.
Binomial Distribution, which involves repeated Bernoulli trials.
Poisson Distribution, which counts occurrences over time or space.

Continuous Distributions include:
Normal or Gaussian Distribution, which follows a bell curve and is used in weight initialization and loss functions.
Exponential Distribution models waiting times between events.
Uniform Distribution assigns equal probability across a range.

These distributions are critical in defining loss functions and model assumptions in deep learning.

Maximum Likelihood.
Maximum likelihood estimation, or MLE, is a statistical method to estimate parameters of a probability distribution by maximizing the likelihood of observed data.
The log-likelihood function simplifies calculations by converting multiplication into summation.
MLE is fundamental in training machine learning models, especially in optimizing loss functions like cross-entropy.

Training Data.
Training data is the dataset used to train deep learning models.
Good training data should be diverse, accurately labeled, sufficient in volume, and free of noise.
Data preprocessing techniques include normalization, data augmentation, handling missing values, and shuffling.
High-quality training data leads to better generalization and model accuracy.

Maximum Likelihood-Based Cost.
Loss functions in deep learning often derive from MLE.
Cross-entropy loss is commonly used in classification tasks.
The goal is to minimize this function to improve model accuracy.
Other cost functions include Mean Squared Error for regression tasks and Hinge Loss for Support Vector Machines.

Neuroscience Inspiration.
Deep learning is inspired by how the brain processes information in layers.
Concepts borrowed from neuroscience include:
Neurons and Synapses, which correspond to artificial neurons and weights.
Action Potentials, which correspond to activation functions like ReLU.
Hebbian Learning, which is similar to how neural networks update weights.
Spiking Neural Networks mimic how biological neurons process information and are more energy-efficient.

Neuroscience contributes to more efficient AI architectures, better learning rules, and advancements in brain-computer interfaces.
